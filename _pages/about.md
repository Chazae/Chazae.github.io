I graduated from Whatcom Community College in 2021 with an Associates of Science in Cybersecurity.

My courses included:
  Open Source Operating Systems
  Cisco Networking I, II, and III
  Network Security I and II

My experience at Whatcom was incredible. I learned how to configure a multitude of Cisco Devices through Cisco IOS. I gained experience with snort, burpsuite, and other useful network tools. I physically put together a network from the ground up, and was taught the importance of good cable management.

I also attended Western Washington University from 2014 to 2017 and have 134 credits completed towards a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. I completed the requirements for a Minor in Mathematics.

My course work included:
  Computer Programming I
  Computer Programming and Linear Data Structures
  Data Structures
  Calculus I,II, and III
  Linear Algebra
  Probability and Statistical Inference
  Series and Limits

While at WWU I was a competeing member of the WWU team for the National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition. In 2017 we took 2nd place.

I am currently working on personal projects to keep my skills sharp while I pursue a position within the tech field.

Please check out my projects page while you are here! I have been told that I am great at explaining complicated topics in a way most people can comprehend, and I believe these posts showcase this best.

I am most easily reached by email.
