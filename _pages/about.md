I am currently working on personal projects to keep my skills sharp while I pursue a Technical Support position. My most recent projects have been practicing exploits within a virtual pentesting lab I configured, and developing a video game from the ground up using a combination of Unreal, Blender, Audacity, and GIMP 3.0.

In addition to this, I have familiarized myself with a multitude of different Support Ticket software. These include Freshdesk, Zendesk, Salesforce, Service Desk, and Bold Desk. I learned these so I would be able to start mastering any Support Ticket software that I may encounter.

Please check out my projects page while you are here! I have been told that I am great at explaining complicated topics in a way most people can comprehend, and I believe these posts showcase best.

I graduated from Whatcom Community College in 2021 with an **Associates of Science** in ***Cybersecurity***.

>My courses included:
> -*Open Source Operating Systems*  
> -*Cisco Networking I, II, and III*

My experience at Whatcom was incredible. I learned how to configure a multitude of Cisco Devices through Cisco IOS. I gained experience with snort, burpsuite, and other useful network tools. I physically put together a network from the ground up, and was taught the importance of good cable management.

I also attended **Western Washington University** from 2014 to 2017 and have **134 credits completed** towards a **Bachelors of Science** in ***Computer Science***. I completed the requirements for a **Minor** in ***Mathematics***.
