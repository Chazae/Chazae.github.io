## About Me

Currently working as an **IT Service Desk Technician** for **MacDonald-Miller Facility Solutions**. My team provides technical support for a company of 1700 people, many of which are Local Union workers. Users are managed in a Hybrid Enviroment using both **Active Directory** and **M365**. In addition, we manage requests from users through the **Zendesk** platform.

As a result of working in the service industry for the past 13 years, my soft skills are top notch. Understanding a persons needs, and stressors quickly is key to striving in sensitive situations. **When providing an IT solution, efficient Root Cause Analysis can be jump started through effective listening and communicating**.

**Please check out my [projects](https://chazae.github.io/projects) page while you are here!** I am great at explaining complicated topics in a way most people can comprehend. I believe these posts showcase this best. My main motivation for learning is to share it with those around me! So let me know what you think, and shoot me a message if something does not make sense!

Graduated from **Whatcom Community College** in 2021 with a **Associate of Science** in ***Cybersecurity***.

My courses included:  
> -*Open Source Operating Systems*  
> -*Cisco Networking I, II, and III*  
> -*Network Security I and II*  
> -*Industrial Control Systems Security*  
> -*Digital Forensics*

My experience at Whatcom was incredibly tangible. I learned how to configure a multitude of Cisco devices through **Cisco IOS**. I gained experience with **Snort**, **Burpsuite**, **nmap**, and other useful network tools. I commonly used **Linux(Debian/Redhat)**, **Virtualization software**, and **packetTracer** in course work.

The Cisco Networking series of classes had us learn how to set up a multitude of networks from the ground up. It covered the entirety of the CCNA Certification exam. Course work included **subnetting**, **configuring Cisco Switches**, and **configuring/troubleshooting a variety of networks**.

Industrial Control Systems Security covered security concepts tailored to embedded and/or live systems. It taught security concepts pertaining to **programmable logic controllers** and security ideas like a **Data Diode**. This course prepared me to take the first step towards helping secure critical infrastructure like **dams**, **windmills**, **nuclear power plants**, etc.

Digital Forensics covered a vast amount of material pertaining to **digital fingerprints**, **meta-data**, **file recovery**, **network scans**, and **intrusion detection/prevention systems**. Using tools like **Snort**, we set rules and monitored their effect using **WireShark**. For web pages we used **Burpsuite** to collect, disseminate, and organize data. The basics of steganography were also taught.

Attended **Western Washington University** from 2014 to 2017 and have **134 credits completed** towards a **Bachelor of Science** in ***Computer Science***. I completed the requirements for a **Minor** in ***Mathematics***.

My courses included:  
> -*Computer Programming I*  
> -*Computer Programming and Linear Data Structures*  
> -*Data Structures*  
> -*Calculus I,II, and III*  
> -*Linear Algebra*  
> -*Probability and Statistical Inference*  
> -*Series and Limits*  

Most of my coursework at Western revolved around **mathematics**, **python**, **java**, and **statistics**. I am capable of writing scripts with multiple different python libraries and am capable of learning new ones quickly. **I can incorporate the fundamentals of data structures and sorting algorithms when trying to parse/organize raw data.** Due to my mathematics background, I am comfortable learning and applying advanced filtering algorithms when investigating data sets.

I was an **active member** of multiple clubs including the **Collegiate Cyber Defense Club** and **Video Game Design Club**. As a competing member of the WWU team for the **National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition**, I was in charge of administering and hardening a Windows server acting as the Domain Controller. As the exact operating system of the Domain Controller was a mystery until the event, I had to learn how to set up and defend this service on multiple versions of Windows Server.  
**In 2017 we took 2nd place in the Pacific Rim.**
