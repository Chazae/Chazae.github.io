I am currently working on personal projects to keep my skills sharp while I pursue a Technical Support position. My most recent projects have been practicing exploits within a virtual pentesting lab I configured, and developing a video game from the ground up using a combination of Unreal, Blender, Audacity, and GIMP 3.0.

Independent of coursework, I have studied and simulated a multitude of different Support Ticket software. These include Freshdesk, Zendesk, Salesforce, Service Desk, and Bold Desk. I learned these to be able to quickly adapt to any Support Ticket software that I may encounter.

**Please check out my projects page while you are here!** I am great at explaining complicated topics in a way most people can comprehend, and I believe these posts showcase this best. They also show that I am motivated and eager to learn new technical topics outside of the workspace.

My resume, projects, and blog can be found in the navitgation bar.  

**Below** I have a list of relevant courses I've completed with a brief explanation of what I learned from both **Whatcom Community College** and **Western Washington University**.

My experience at Whatcom was incredible. I learned how to configure a multitude of Cisco Devices through Cisco IOS. I gained experience with snort, burpsuite, and other useful network tools. I physically put together a network from the ground up, and was taught the importance of good cable management.

I also attended **Western Washington University** from 2014 to 2017 and have **134 credits completed** towards a **Bachelors of Science** in ***Computer Science***. I completed the requirements for a **Minor** in ***Mathematics***.
