Currently working on personal projects to keep my skills sharp while I pursue a **Technical Support position**. My most recent projects have been practicing exploits within a virtual pentesting lab I configured, and developing a video game from the ground up using a combination of **Unreal**, **Blender**, **Audacity**, and **GIMP 3.0**.

As a result of working in the service industry for the past 13 years, my soft skills are top notch. Understanding a consumers needs, and having the relevant skills to solve their issues at hand are key to striving in those spaces. **In the tech field, efficient Root Cause Analysis problem solving can be jump started through effective listening and communicating**.

Independent of coursework, I have studied and simulated a multitude of different Support Ticket software. These include **Freshdesk**, **Zendesk**, **Salesforce**, **Service Desk**, and **Bold Desk**. I learned these to be able to quickly adapt to any Support Ticket software that I may encounter.

**Please check out my [projects](https://chazae.github.io/projects) page while you are here!** I am great at explaining complicated topics in a way most people can comprehend, and I believe these posts showcase this best. They also show just how motivated and eager I am to learn new technical topics outside of the workspace.

My [resume](https://chazae.github.io/cv), [projects](https://chazae.github.io/projects), and [blog](https://chazae.github.io/blog) can be found in the navigation bar above.

**Below** I have a list of relevant courses I've completed with a brief explanation of what I learned from both **Whatcom Community College** and **Western Washington University**.

  ---

Graduated from **Whatcom Community College** in 2021 with a **Associate of Science** in ***Cybersecurity***.

>My courses included:  
> -*Open Source Operating Systems*  
> -*Cisco Networking I, II, and III*  
> -*Network Security I and II*  
> -*Industrial Control Systems Security*  
> -*Digital Forensics*

My experience at Whatcom was incredibly tangible. I learned how to configure a multitude of Cisco devices through **Cisco IOS**. I gained experience with **Snort**, **Burpsuite**, **nmap**, and other useful network tools. I commonly used **Linux(Debian/Redhat)**, **Virtualization software**, and **packetTracer** in course work.

The Cisco Networking series of classes had us learn how to set up a multitude of networks from the ground up. It covered the entirety of the CCNA Certification exam. Course work included **subnetting**, **configuring Cisco Switches**, and **configuring/troubleshooting a variety of networks**. 

Industrial Control Systems Security covered security concepts tailored to embedded and/or live systems. It taught security concepts pertaining to **programmable logic controllers** and security ideas like a **Data Diode**. This course prepared me to take the first step towards helping secure critical infrastructure like **dams**, **windmills**, **nuclear power plants**, etc.

Digital Forensics covered a vast amount of material pertaining to **digital fingerprints**, **meta-data**, **file recovery**, **network scans**, and **intrusion detection/prevention systems**. Using tools like **Snort**, we set rules and monitored their effect using **WireShark**. For web pages we used **Burpsuite** to collect, disseminate, and organize data. The basics of steganography were also taught.

Attended **Western Washington University** from 2014 to 2017 and have **134 credits completed** towards a **Bachelor of Science** in ***Computer Science***. I completed the requirements for a **Minor** in ***Mathematics***.

>My courses included:  
> -*Computer Programming I*  
> -*Computer Programming and Linear Data Structures*  
> -*Data Structures*  
> -*Calculus I,II, and III*  
> -*Linear Algebra*  
> -*Probability and Statistical Inference*  
> -*Series and Limits*  

Most of my coursework at Western revolved around **mathematics**, **python**, **java**, and **statistics**. I am capable of writing scripts with multiple different python libraries and am capable of learning new ones quickly. **I can incorporate the fundamentals of data structures and sorting algorithms when trying to parse/organize raw data.** Due to my mathematics background, I am comfortable learning and applying advanced filtering algorithms when investigating data sets.

I was an **active member** of multiple clubs including the **Collegiate Cyber Defense Club** and **Video Game Design Club**. As a competing member of the WWU team for the **National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition**, I was in charge of administering and hardening a Windows server acting as the Domain Controller. As the exact operating system of the Domain Controller was a mystery until the event, I had to learn how to set up and defend this service on multiple versions of Windows Server.  
**In 2017 we took 2nd place in the Pacific Rim.**
